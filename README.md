# Neural Network
A neural network can be defined as a computational model inspired by the structure and function of the biological neural networks, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process and transmit information by performing simple computations. These computations are determined by the weights assigned to the connections between neurons and the activation functions applied to their outputs. Neural networks can learn patterns and make predictions based on input data, and are widely used in various applications such as image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing.

- The very first model program of Neural Network. The model used a single layer neural network built with TensorFlow to analyze the predictions.

- Got introduced to the field of Computer Vision. It's all about teaching a computer to understand and label what is present in an image. I worked on my first computer vision project using the Fashion MNIST dataset, which comprises of 70,000 images and 10 categories, all with a resolution of 28x28. I was thrilled to train a neural network with three layers and see the results for myself.
